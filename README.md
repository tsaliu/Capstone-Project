# Capstone-Project
Capstone Project with SUNLAB and iBIONICS at University of Ottawa

The purpose of the project is to develop a prototype of avisual prosthesis system with electrical engineering's solution.
The prosthesis mainly targets people who haev retinal degenerative diseases. The requirements of the project are:
  1. Be able to capture, down resolution, gray-scaled the video stream that a person should see
  2. To transmit the video stream through laser on a photovoltaic chip with any coding, modulation, algorithm nesscary
  3. Assemble a system that roughly resemble a person's eye, where the photovoltaic chip is attach onto the back of the eye
  4. Track the person's eye movement and re-direct the laser onto the pupil
  5. To decode, demodulate, the video stream and display
