# Capstone-Project
Capstone Project with SUNLAB and iBIONICS at University of Ottawa

  The purpose of the project is to develop a prototype of a visual prosthesis system with electrical engineering's solution.
The prosthesis mainly targets people who have retinal degenerative diseases. This project can be roughly divided into two major parts:
  - Tracking eye's movement and re-directing the laser with data stream
  - Wireless communication between two ends through laser over freespace
  
The requirements of the project are:
  1. Be able to capture, down resolution, gray-scaled the video stream that a person should see
  2. To transmit the video stream through laser on a photovoltaic chip with any coding, modulation, algorithm nesscary
  3. Assemble a system that roughly resemble a person's eye, where the photovoltaic chip is attach onto the back of the eye
  4. Track the person's eye movement and re-direct the laser onto the pupil
  5. To decode, demodulate, the video stream and display
  
  My contribution to this project is to handle all the telecommunication functions and also the control of the reflective mirror stand with 2 axis of freedom with 2 servo motors. The tracking portion is handled by Anas Zurkiyeh. The system that resemble a human eye is physically assembled and built in Mcgill University by their Mechanical Engineering students as their own capstone project. The control of that system (Target) is written by Noor Allami.
